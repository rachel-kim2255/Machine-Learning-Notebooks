[![Jupyter Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notebook-View%20on%20GitHub-orange?logo=jupyter&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/rachel-kim2255/Machine-Learning-Notebooks/blob/main/1_%5BML_Linear_Model%5D_Predicting_Insurance_Premiums.ipynb)

> This project aims to forecast insurance costs by leveraging demographic and health indicators, such as **age, gender, and BMI**. The primary goal is to understand the practical application of **linear regression** and interpret how individual features influence medical charges.

### **Key Results**
* **R² Score**: 0.736 (Explains ~73.6% of the variance)
* **RMSE**: 5,684
* **Main Insight**: Smoking status and age were identified as the most significant predictors of insurance premiums.
